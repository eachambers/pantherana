# Data directory

This directory is empty because data files aren't stored in GitHub. To run code in this repository, download files within the two data input file directories that are on Dryad [here](XXX) (`2_Data_processing/data_files_input_into_scripts` and `4_Data_visualization/data_files_input_into_scripts`) and dump them all into this directory.
